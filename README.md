# SmartCity-Realtime-Streaming-Data-Ingestion

This is an End to End Realtime data streaming pipeline covering each phase from data ingestion to processing and finally storage. the data is simulated using a python program which is further undergoes processing utilizing tools like Apache Zookeeper, Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Docker, Python, AWS Cloud, AWS Glue, AWS Athena, AWS IAM, AWS Redshift and finally PowerBI to visualize data on Redshift.

# Project Description

The project simulates the data for the car travel between two cities in United States. The simulation captures the data generated by Car, the GPS data, data captured with the help of Camera, the Weather data and the data related to any kind of emergency situation the driver may encounter in his journey. Data is captured in real-time and is captured with the help of Apache Kafka and is further being consumed by Apach Spark.
The streaming data consumed by APache Spark is further being stored into Amazon S3 datalake, from where it is transformed with the help of AWS Glue Catalog. The transformed data is further stored into a target database in AWS Redhift with the help of Dbeaver and can be used to perform further analysis. The transformed and cleaned data from Redshift can be fetched on Tableau / Power BI / Looker studio to gain actionable insights.
